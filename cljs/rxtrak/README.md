# rxTrak&trade;

A toy medication tracking demo leveraging the mxWeb&trade; UI un-framework, itself the poster child for Matrix&trade;, a point granular dataflow library supporting a new programming paradigm. Gasp.

> You say "reactive" we say "dataflow".

## Overview

rxTrak hopes to carry developers down the rest of the functional path on which Facebook's ReactJS has started them. Thanks to ReactJS, the programming hoi polloi has discovered the joy of declarative, functional programming. Unfortunately, the FB engineers dropped us off before the hard part: state management.

> Nothing challenges software more than managing UI state as an intelligent user does their earnest best to use a computer interface correctly. 

Remember Scotty trying to talk into the Macintosh mouse? Nuff said. But FB engineers claimed as a feature that they would not tell us how to manage state, the problem Fred Brooks deemed so intractable that _No Silver Bullet_ was possible. Oddly, FB engineers then specified how to manage state. Flux.

![Flux](documentation/flux.png)

Mike Thompson did a good job cleaning up Flux with ClojureScript `re-frame`, and Dan Abramov made a brave but verbose attempt with Redux, but what started simple scaled to ornate. As with everything Lisps touch, ClojureScript re-frame by Mike Thompson turned out vastly better, but the exposed wiring of Flux remained.

### Pub-Sub no mas
Enter Hoplon/Javelin, the Reagent ratom, MobX, and binding.Scala. These truly reactive frameworks support a more natural expression of the one-way dataflow Facebook engineers correctly identified as vital to front-end developer sanity, one in which the framework magically identifies and automates the dataflow DAG implicit in the natural coding of an interface.

> Facebook now says React was the wrong name, say it should have been called ScheduleJS, and go so far as to reject the reactive paradigm because of its unscheduled eagerness.

By "natural" we mean "without giving architecture any thought", React components being the perfect example. We just think about our application semantics, author views declaratively, mutate application state in response to user gestures, and then...we are done.

### All dataflow all the time
Our FB heros made clear that their library only managed the view. Matrix applications extend the declarative/functional model to any aspect we care enough about to glue. Tcl/Tk, GTk, OpenGL, a persistent CLOS database, a Postgres implementation of a graph DB, browser local storage, Ajax XHR requests have all been connected in one seamless dataflow network in various Matrix applications. mxWeb itself is hundreds of lines of code extending dataflow to the DOM, obviating any need for VDOM and its diffing.

### Enough yapping
The rest of this page describes how to run the completed demo. Over in the documentation we will walk you through how to build it yourself, introducing first Matrix dataflow and then the mxWeb un-framework.

## Development

In a terminal window, clone the entire Matrix repo:
* `git clone https://github.com/kennytilton/matrix.git`

Navigate to the rxTrak project:
* `cd matrix/cljs/rxtrak`

Tidy up:
* `lein clean`

Start the application in a browser:
* `lein fig:build`

This ^^^ will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:
* `(js/alert "Am I connected?")`

...and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:
* `lein clean`

To create a production build run:
* `lein clean`
* `lein fig:min`
